## A little mod that adds S-bahn commuter trains and trams to the game.

### Installation:
-Download the code and unzip if neccessary

-move the valdotoriums_Trains folder into Subwaybuilders mod folder. You can open this folder from the mod settings in game.

-Enable the mod. It could be that you have to disable, re-enable and reload mods everytime you start the game.

### Trains

**S-Bahn**
-Fairly high capacity
-Fast, up to 140 km/h
-4,8,12 car options
-allows at-grade crossings, but use responsibly!
-More expensive to build not at-grade.

**Trams**
-Allows street-running
-By far the cheapest option when building at-grade
-Slower - maximum 50kmh (to "simulate" mixed traffic) and rather low capacity

### How did i make this mod?
-basically it implements things that have already been written in the Subwaybuilder modding docs: https://www.subwaybuilder.com/docs/v1.0.0
-Used the structure for index.js that mhmoeller used for his Copenhagen City mod: https://github.com/mhmoeller/SubwayBuilder-CPH
